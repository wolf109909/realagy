# realagy

A minimal [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) provider for Google Antigravity. It runs the local Antigravity CLI as an ACP server (`agy acp`) and exposes the account's Gemini, Claude, and GPT models as ordinary `antigravity/*` pi models. The model works with pi's tools instead of agy's own, and pi keeps the transcript.

## Install

Install the [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/acp/), sign in once with it, then add the extension:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash
agy                                   # sign in (or: agy acp --login)
pi install git:github.com/st0nie/realagy
```

realagy looks for `agy` in `AGY_BIN`, then on `PATH`, then at `~/.local/bin/agy`. It never installs agy or handles credentials, so pi's `/login` has nothing to configure for `antigravity`. If agy is missing or signed out, pi says so at startup; `/agy setup` checks again and shows the install or sign-in steps. agy updates itself.

Choose a model in pi's `/model` picker:

| Model | Thinking |
| --- | --- |
| `antigravity/gemini-4-argon`, `antigravity/gemini-3-1-pro`, `antigravity/gemini-3-8-flash` | low / medium / high |
| `antigravity/claude-opus-5-5`, `antigravity/claude-sonnet-5-5` | low / medium / high |
| `antigravity/gpt-oss-120b` | medium (text only, no image input) |

The catalog comes live from agy and depends on the account.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/agy settings` | Edit the Pi token limits and Agy auto-compaction bypass |
| `/agy setup` | Checks agy: shows install steps when it is missing, sign-in steps when it cannot start a session, and reloads the model catalog when it is ready |
| `/agy usage` | Cache-hit rate for this session plus every quota group's 5-hour and weekly remaining share and reset times (from the live `agy acp` server, or `agy --print /usage`) |

Quota is fetched only when you run `/agy usage`. There is no engine switch, delegation tool, or global MCP registration.

## Pi tools and agy's own tools

realagy starts agy with its own hidden agent profile, `~/.gemini/config/agents/realagy-<hash>.md`. It replaces agy's system prompt (Antigravity's identity, artifacts, IDE slash commands, and its rule to write every file and symbol as a `file://` link) with a short prompt of realagy's, and leaves the model with pi's tools only: agy's `read_file`, `run_command`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, subagents, and web search are gone. pi's tools stay direct tools, so their calls go through pi's permissions and show up as pi tool calls. File references arrive as plain paths (`src/app.ts:10-20`); a `file://` link a model still writes is rewritten to one while the reply streams. The profile is hidden from normal agy sessions (only `agy agents` lists it), changes only processes realagy starts, and is deleted after 7 days without use.

With `REALAGY_AGY_PROFILE=0` (or when the profile cannot be written) agy keeps its default agent. The model then sees pi's tools next to agy's built-in ones, since agy cannot switch its own tools off. realagy adds a short policy to agy's system prompt that asks the model to use pi's tools for reading files (images included), running commands, and changing files, to work itself instead of starting subagents, background tasks, or scheduled tasks, and to write plain paths instead of `file://` links. agy's own tools still work when the model picks them, and pi always shows it:

- each finished call adds a line to the reply's thinking, for example `agy → run_command npm test ✓ 2.1s`;
- while agy works on its own, a live panel above the editor lists each running call, background command, and subagent with a spinner and its elapsed time (the 5-minute inactivity limit waits for a running call);
- a command agy moved to the background, or a subagent, is marked `(runs in background)`. When it finishes, a tool card with the exit code and the last 5 lines of its output (expand it with ctrl+o or a left click for the whole output and the log path) is added to the conversation and pi's agent reacts to it: right away when idle, otherwise after its current work. agy's own leftover output never leaks into your next reply.

## Interrupts and failures

- Esc cancels the running Antigravity turn through ACP. agy keeps running, and the next prompt continues in the same session. agy is restarted only if it ignores the cancel for 10 seconds.
- Starting a new prompt while Antigravity still waits on pi tool results (for example, after the tool calls were interrupted) ends that stale turn instead of waiting for it to time out.
- When agy answers that its servers are busy ("high traffic"), the turn fails as an overload error, so pi retries it instead of keeping the notice as the answer.
- If agy cannot start or exits mid-turn, the turn fails with the binary path, the exit code, and agy's last error line. The next prompt starts it again. A turn with no output for 5 minutes is stopped, unless one of agy's own tools is still running.
- After `/reload`, `pi -c`, or `/tree`, realagy resumes the matching Antigravity session. If agy's copy of that conversation is gone, the next prompt starts a new session with the full pi transcript.

## Pi limits and agy compaction

Run `/agy settings` to edit all three options in a menu. **Save and close** persists the
values in `~/.pi/agent/realagy/settings.json` and applies them immediately: Pi's model
metadata refreshes, and a changed bypass setting restarts Agy before its next turn.
Pi does not need to be restarted. Environment variables supply defaults, with saved
menu values taking precedence per field; restart Pi after changing environment variables.

Pi's model metadata and agy's compaction bypass are independent. Every model is reported
to pi with a 256,000-token context window and 64,000-token output limit by default;
both values can be changed without enabling the proxy.

With `REALAGY_NO_COMPACT=1`, realagy starts an embedded loopback reverse proxy and
starts agy with its `--cloud_code_endpoint` pointing there. Only the model catalog is
buffered: realagy disables each checkpointer experiment and defeats its token-limit
clamps. Generation, authentication, quota calls, and streaming RPCs pass through the
same proxy without content changes. Existing `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`
settings are honored; no CA, mitmproxy, or system proxy change is needed.

The bypass does not increase real server-side model limits. When a conversation reaches
the actual limit, the request fails instead of agy automatically summarizing it. The
Pi-reported window and output settings do not change those real limits either.

| Environment | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `AGY_BIN` | Path to the `agy` binary |
| `GEMINI_HOME` | agy's data root (default `~/.gemini`) |
| `REALAGY_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | Context window reported to pi for every model (default `256000`) |
| `REALAGY_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Output limit reported to pi for every model (default `64000`) |
| `REALAGY_NO_COMPACT` | `1` enables the embedded proxy and disables agy's local automatic compaction (default off) |
| `REALAGY_AGY_PROFILE` | `0` keeps agy's default agent (its own prompt and tools) instead of realagy's profile |
| `REALAGY_TRACE_USAGE` | `1` or an absolute path: log turn plans and token counts (no content) to `~/.pi/agent/realagy/usage-trace.jsonl` |

| `src/native-tools.ts`, `src/acp/background.ts`, `src/background-card.ts` | Thinking lines and the live panel for agy's own tool calls; finished background work as a conversation card that wakes pi's agent |
| `src/stream-sanitizer.ts`, `src/file-links.ts`, `src/frame-guard.ts`, `src/redact.ts` | Hiding injected `<SYSTEM_MESSAGE>` blocks, rewriting `file://` links to plain paths, dropping stdout noise, redacting secrets from logs and errors |
| `tests/` | Vitest suites; `tests/helpers/fake-acp-server.mjs` stands in for agy |
| `scripts/` | Live smokes and probes (spend account quota) |

## Build

```sh
bun install            # or npm install
npm run check          # TypeScript + tests
npm run smoke:pi       # load the extension through pi's real loader
```

[docs/development.md](docs/development.md) has the live smokes and the conventions.

## Protocol note

agy offers third-party models only to clients it recognizes, so realagy declares `clientInfo.name = "zed"` to get the same Claude/GPT catalog Zed sees. Sign-in, quotas, and generation all still go through Google's official agy CLI and Cloud Code endpoint. The optional loopback proxy forwards that same traffic and never bypasses quota checks.
